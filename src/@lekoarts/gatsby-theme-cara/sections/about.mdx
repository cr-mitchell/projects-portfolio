## A Little About Me

> I am a multifacted and intellectually curious human being. Someone who not only cares to build things with a passion like no other, but takes their time to create the best possible product. 

I was borned in raised in Chicago, Illinois and now attend Tufts University where I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics. STEM is not my only passion however. I find myself building very strong friendships with people I meet everywhere. I would say I am a pretty big extrovert. I love cooking, eating, and sometimes I even find myself knitting and reading a book. That's something I never thought I would say!
