## A Little About Me

> I am a multifacted and intellectually curious human being. Someone who not only cares to build things with a passion like no other, but takes their time to create the best possible product. 

I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois and now attend Tufts University where I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics. STEM is not my only passion however. I find myself building very strong friendships with people I meet everywhere. I would say I am a pretty big extrovert. I love cooking, eating, running, and sometimes I even find myself knitting, reading a book, and golfing when I have some free time. Those are a few things I'd never thought I would do for fun, but trying new things could open up many realms of many new possibilities and interests, and I live by that saying!
